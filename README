# React App with Authentication, Home Page, and Lazy Loading

This is a React application that demonstrates various features, including authentication, a home page, and lazy loading with an API. The app allows users to sign up, sign in, reset their passwords, and access a restricted home page once authenticated. It also implements lazy loading to efficiently fetch and display a large dataset from an API.

## Features

- Authentication Page: Users can sign up, sign in, and reset their passwords using a refresh token.
- Home Page: Accessible only to authenticated users, displaying relevant content.
- Lazy Loading with API: Fetches a large dataset from an API and implements lazy loading to load additional data as the user scrolls or interacts with the page.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Router: Library for handling routing within a React application.
- [Library/Framework of Your Choice]: Used for implementing the authentication functionality (e.g., Firebase, Superbase).
- [UI Library of Your Choice]: Optional library for styling the components (e.g., Mantine, MUI).

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: HTML file that serves as the entry point for the React app.
- `src/`
  - `App.js`: React component for setting up routing and rendering the appropriate components based on the URL.
  - `Authentication.js`: React component that implements the authentication page.
  - `Home.js`: React component for the home page.
  - `LazyLoading.js`: React component that implements lazy loading functionality with the provided API.
  - Other necessary files and directories (e.g., styles, additional components).
